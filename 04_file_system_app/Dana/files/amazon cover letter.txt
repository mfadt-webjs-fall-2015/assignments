Hello,

	I am interested in applying to either the Amazon User Experience Design Internship, or Amazon User Experience Design Technologist Internship. I am currently a first year student at Parsons MFA Design and Technology Program and have learned about this opportunity through professors at my school.

	I am passionate about using technology + art in creative ways, and I am currently in graduate school to build up my skills in masterfully executing and designing creative projects. So far in my first semester I have gained technical skills in Javascript, HTML, CSS, Processing, Arduino, and much more. I have also significantly increased my skills in iterating through ideas and prototypes to come up with effective plans and solutions. 

	My background includes Graphic Design, Fine Art, and Media and Culture studies at NYU. I have previously worked at an advertising agency Mccann Erickson as a Graphic Designer, at NYU in the Information Technology Services as an Outreach Strategist/Content Producer/Graphic Designer, as well as at a technology start-up as a Graphic Designer.

	Thank you for your time and I am looking forward to meeting with you at the Parsons meet up event to further discuss the position!

Best,
Dana Avesar
