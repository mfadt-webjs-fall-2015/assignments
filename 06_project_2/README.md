# Project #2

### Assignment

Team up with another student and build a websockets-based app. Any bi-directional communication is valid here: client <--> server, hardware <--> server. Please notice that *bi-directional* is a requirement. We're looking for true communication, sending and receiving data/messages/actions/inputs back and forth.
