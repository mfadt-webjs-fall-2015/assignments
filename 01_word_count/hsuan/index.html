	<h5>What’s expected of a “full stack” developer is far beyond the capabilities of an ordinary human. They need to understand how to scale an app to handle millions of hits a day (or hour?), what “pets vs. cattle” means and why it’s important, the reason they should choose MongoDB over MySQL (or vice versa), the CAP theorem, PaaS’s, IaaS’s, a dozen configuration management tools, whether it makes sense to built an app in Rails, Django, Wordpress, Swift or a combination based on the requirements, micro services versus monolithic apps, and two dozen other things.

	This means that the full stack developer needs at least a solid enough understanding of each component of the stack to be able to make educated decisions on the use of them and to be able to explain it, ideally in plain english, to management. That’s right, on the very top of this stack is an expectation that the full stack developer has strong english skills, can work well with others, and can explain highly technical concepts to middle / upper management.

	Every year there are new components added to each layer and every couple of years there’s a new layer added to it. Is it really reasonable to put out job applications asking for a full stack developer? It’s not only unreasonable, it’s stupid. Particularly when you start looking for one person who’s an expert in security, web development, UX, and servers; and this isn’t at all an uncommon expectation.

	To top it off, since it’s often a startup looking for a full stack developer or engineer, that person is also often required to project manage and gather user requirements.

	Oh ya, and then when the CEO is in the office, to get his printer and file sharing on his brand new Windows laptop working again.
