     Read Me:
     
     This project is go to let people share information in a safe way. Use Cipherbook users can encode their text information and decode it. It allow users just speak to
the web page. Web speech API help users to translate voice to text. Then users can encode it.

      Additional thing:
      When I want to make a encode and decode web. At first I looked processing for help. Because I know how to use it but I just started to learn Javascript. I want to use it as a draft or I can write a java program and use "<script></script>" to combine the java and html.
      But after I tried for several days. I found processing is to complex to encode. I need a library to help me to store all the ciphers.
      So I start to study how to solve this problem in Javascript. After searching for a long time and asked some friends around me. I still can't find the way. Then I asked my friends in China who is really good at coding. He tell me to try to use base64. Then I found this page:
http://scotch.io/quick-tips/js/how-to-encode-and-decode-strings-with-base64-in-javascript
It tell me how to encode and decode text just in 6 lines of code.
      Because I started it from nothing. This project helped me a lot with javascript.
