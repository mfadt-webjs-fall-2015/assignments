	<div class="description"> Meerkats are very social, living in colonies. Animals in the same group groom each other regularly to warn others of approaching dangers. Meerkats also babysit the young in the group and meerkat young learn by observing and mimicking adult behaviour.
	<br/><br/>
	They think highly of the relationship between others and they are active in social network. They might also a extrovert in the real life, or actually they actually withdraw in real life and take social network as a media to compensate the relationship between others.</div>
